# GlacierBackup

A Python script to backup folders to 
[Amazon Glacier](http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/).

## Usage

Run `python glacierBackup.py --help` for full usage details.

## Dependencies

This project uses [paulengstler's glacier library](http://paulengstler.github.com/glacier/) to make calls to AWS

## Coming Soon

Right now this script only puts data into Glacier.  I'm hoping
to add the ability to get data back out soon.  Pull requests 
are always welcome.
